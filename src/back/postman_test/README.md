# POSTMAN TESTING
You can use Postman to test the REST APIs

## Notice about Access Tokens
- Whenever using Postman, make sure that the API call has an updated **identity-token** otherwise the call will not work. 
- Refer to the API documentation on how to use APIs
- Utilize the AWS/Authentication folder to get the identity-token and refresh-token
